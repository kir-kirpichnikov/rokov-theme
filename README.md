# Rokov Theme

This is my first theme for Visual Studio Code. Dark and high contrast theme.

I created this theme for my needs, but maybe you will like it. The theme will be improved in the future.

## Font

I recommend using [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/lp/mono/) Readability of text on a black background depends a lot on the font you choose, so be careful.

## Installation

1. Open the extensions sidebar on Visual Studio Code
2. Search for "Rokov Theme"
3. Click install
4. Chose "Rokov Theme" in the Command Palette
5. Rate? :)
